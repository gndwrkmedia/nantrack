## Setting up your Gemini API Key

This project uses the Gemini API for its AI-powered features. To use them, you'll need to get an API key and add it to your project.

1.  Create an API key for the Gemini API in Google AI Studio.
2.  Open the `.env` file in the root of your project.
3.  Add your API key to the file like this: `GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE`

And that's it! The AI features should now be enabled.
